        - With physical products we have to feel like we dominate them
            - 'Jobs had aimed for the simplicity that comes from conquering complexities, not ignoring them.'

    - Perfection
        - Never shipped until perfect
        - Caring about the parts unseen
        - End to end control of the user experience
