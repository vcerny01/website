-   [Leningen](https://leiningen.org/)
    -   Mostly used for managing [[Clojure]] projects today
-   REPL
    -   The REPL is a tool for experimenting with code.
    -   It allows you to interact with a running program and quickly try out ideas.
    -   It does this by presenting you with a prompt where you can enter code. It then reads your input, evaluates it, prints the result, and loops, presenting you with a prompt again.
    -   REPL is an essencial part of the Lisp experience
-   [[Emacs]]
    -   The most used IDE in Clojure development
    -   Emacs is just an (e)lisp interpreter, that's why it's extremely modifiable
    -   Everything in emacs is a function
        -   The Cider package is very used for Clojure development in Emacs
