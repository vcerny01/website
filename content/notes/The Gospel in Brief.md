## Review
The [biography of Ludwig Wittgenstein](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12079.Ludwig_Wittgenstein) mentions that Wittgenstein was very much influenced by this book, so I decided to read it. While I don't really agree with it (the Catholic viewpoints usually make more sense to me), it was definitely worth reading.
