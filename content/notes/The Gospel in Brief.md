## Review
In the [biography of Ludwig Wittgenstein](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12079.Ludwig_Wittgenstein) I read, it was mentioned that Wittgenstein was very much influenced by this book, so I decided to read myself. While I don't agree with everything (the Catholic viewpoints make more sense to me in some places), it was definitely interesting read.
