- The source of our unease
        - > "The source of our unease is not evident in these thin-sliced case studies, but instead becomes visible only when confronting the thicker reality of how these technologies as a whole have managed to expand beyond the minor roles for which we initially adopted them. Increasingly, they dictate how we behave and how we feel, and somehow coerce us to use them more than we think is healthy, often at the expense of other activities we find more valuable. It's not about usefulness, it's about autonomy."
        - Technology companies recognize the power of this unpredictable positive feedback hook and tweak their products with it in mind to make their appeal even stronger. (The drive for social approval)
    - > To reestablish control, we need to move beyond tweaks and instead rebuild our relationship with technology from scratch, using our deeply held values as a foundation.
