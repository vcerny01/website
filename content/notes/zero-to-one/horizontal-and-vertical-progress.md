- > When we think about the future, we hope for a future of Progress. That progress can take one of two forms. Horizontal or extensive progress means copying things that work—going from 1 to n. Horizontal progress is easy to imagine because we already know what it looks like. Vertical or intensive progress means doing new things—going from 0 to 1. Vertical progress is harder to imagine because it requires doing something nobody else has ever done.

    - > Whenever I interview someone for a job, I like to ask this question: “What important truth do very few people agree with you on?”

    - > “Madness is rare in individuals—but in groups, parties, nations, and ages it is the rule,” Friedrich Nietzsche wrote (before he went mad).
