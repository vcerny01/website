This book has been highly influential on my thinking. I recommend you buy it and read it yourself. It's certainly a must-read for every techbro.

For reading my notes, I recommned starting with the note on [horizontal and vertical progress](horizontal-and-vertical-progress) as it is fundamental for Thiel's worldview.
