- Practice: **Solitude**
	- Solitude deprivation
		- > A state in which you spend close to zero time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from other minds.
	- > When you avoid solitude, you miss out on the positive things it brings you: the ability to clarify hard problems, to regulate your emotions, to build moral courage, and to strengthen relationships. If you suffer from chronic solitude deprivation, therefore, the quality of your life degrades.
