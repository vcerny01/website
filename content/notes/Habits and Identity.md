- There are three levels of change: **outcome change**, **process change**, and **identity change.**
	- The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.
	- ==Your identity emerges out of your habits.==
		- Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become
- What are habits
	- A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.
	- ==The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.==
	- Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: **cue**, **craving**, **response** and **reward**
