Since 2020 I've been taking notes digitally, mostly in [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/). I like the idea of [learning in public](https://t.co/eYwVXaTy8W) and sharing one's knowledge online, so I've written a few scripts and established a system of importing some of my notes to this website.

## What notes can you find here

I sort my notes into three categories:

- [Books](/notes/books)

I read a book (nonfiction) and make notes from it.

- [Research](/notes/research)

Notes from some more structured material, something like I took a course or studied a textbook.

- [School](/notes/school/)

People who know me are probably well-aware of my attitude towards the mass education system. And that's why I don't put notes from school as research since school is mostly busywork, not me trying to learn something. Still for the benefit of my peers (and as a motivation for me to do something in the classes), I put some of my better notes online.

## Importing

Most of my notes are imported from Roam, usually via a [small python script](https://github.com/vcerny01/rmdc), which works on top of Roam's markdown export. Among other things, this script basically selects a group of related notes and removes all ties they have to notes outside of that group. This may create some awkward situations in my notes sometimes. 

I import only something, not all is worth sharing

## Languages

Most of my notes are in English, ale některé jsou v češtině.

## Copyright

In my notes, I often quote the sources extensively. Just let me know if you're the copyright holder and don't like something about it.
