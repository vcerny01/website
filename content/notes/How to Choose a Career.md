## Five Predictors of Job Satisfaction 
- The most consistent predictor of jobs satisfaction is engaging work, which can be broken down into 5 factors
	- **Sense of completion**
		- To what extent does the job involve completing a whole piece of work so that your contribution to the end product is easily visible, rather than being merely a small part of a much larger product?
	- **Variety**
		- To what extent does the job require you to perform a range of different activities, using different skills and talents?
	- **Feedback from the job**
		- How easy is it to know whether you’re performing well or badly?
	- **Contribution**
		- To what extent does your work “make a difference,” as defined by positive contributions to the well-being of other people?

## Finding a Job
- It's best to take empirical approach to finding a job
	- Keep a track record to predict how good you'll do in the future
	- Learn as much about the work as you can
	- Go and speak to people in the job
- See your career as a work in progress
	- > Rather than having a fixed career plan, try to have a career “model”—a set of provisional goals and hypotheses that you’re constantly revising as you get new evidence or opportunities. It’s better to have a bad plan than no plan, but only if you’re open to changing it.
- Find where you're uncertain, reduce that uncertainty
	- > Before making a decision, don’t merely try to weigh all the pros and cons as you currently see them (though that is a good thing to do). Ask yourself: What is the single most important piece of information that would be most useful for my career decision? Now, what can I do in order to gain that information?

## How to Have an Impact on a Job

- 2. Through the money you give

## Nonprofits
### Working for a Nonprofit
- If you're considering working for a nonprofit, ask these questions:

	- Will I learn a lot working here?
	- Is the organization money-rich but talent-poor?
	- Am I sure I want to work within nonprofits long-term?
### Starting a Nonprofit

#### Which case should you focus on

	- How much does it affect lives in the short run and long run?

	- Do interventions to make progress within this cause exist, and how strong is the evidence behind those interventions?
	- Do you expect to be able to discover new promising interventions within this cause?
- _Neglectedness_
	- How many resources are already being dedicated to tackling this problem?
	- How well allocated are the resources that are currently being dedicated to the problem?
	- Is there reason to expect that markets or governments can’t solve this problem?
- _Personal fit_
