## Review
Best book I read in 2021, very thought-provoking. A must-read for everyone in tech. The contrarian bible.

I recommend starting with the note on [horizontal and vertical progress](https://vitcerny.xyz/notes/zero-to-one/horizontal-and-vertical-progress) as it is fundamental for Thielâ€™s worldview.
