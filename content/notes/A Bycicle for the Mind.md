## Summary
-   Alan Kay is surprised by the way computers are treated as a commodity in the classroom, rather than as a material to be shaped by students and teachers.
    -   He sees computers as being marketed like automobiles, they do as many things as possible for the user without requiring an understanding of how they work.
    -   The things that students need to do are not necessarily user friendly, they require work and should present a challenge.
        -   Students should be challenged to improve their ability to make images, to think about things and to make representations of things.
        -   A lot of technology is really inverse vandalism; just people making machinery just because they can. The basic idea in education is to facilitate learning in students. The ideas are basic and do not require technology; the machinery should be a tool for learning.
