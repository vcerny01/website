## Introduction

History is in humanities what math is in STEM. And knowing ancient history is as foundational as knowing algebra. So from Decemeber of 2021 to March of 2022 I studied the ancient Greek history. I made some notes along the way.

My main objective was to get a solid overview of ancient Greek history.
