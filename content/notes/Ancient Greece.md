## Introduction

History is in humanities what math is in STEM. And knowing ancient history is as foundational as knowing algebra. So in Decemeber of 2021 I studied the ancient Greek history a bit. I made some notes along the way.

My main objective was to get a solid (undergraduate level one might say) overview of ancient Greek history.
