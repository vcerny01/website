title: What Is Digital Minimalism
---

- Short summary
	- **Digital Minimalism** = A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else.
		- > This minimalist philosophy contrasts starkly with the maximalist philosophy that most people deploy by default mind-set in which any potential for benefit is enough to start using a technology that catches your attention.
- 3 core principles of digital minimalism
	- 1. Clutter is costly
		- > Recognize that cluttering time and attention with too many devices, apps, and services creates an overall negative cost that can swamp the small benefits that each individual item provides in isolation.
	- 2. Optimization is important
		- > Deciding a particular technology supports something you value is only the first step. To truly extract its full potential benefit, it's necessary to think carefully about how they'll use the technology.
	- 3. Intentionality is satisfying
		- > Digital minimalists derive significant satisfaction from their general commitment to being more intentional about how they engage with new technologies. This source of satisfaction is independent of the specific decisions they make and is one of the biggest reasons that minimalism tends to be immensely meaningful to its practitioners.
