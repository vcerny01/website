- Thirty-day period during which you will take a break from optional technologies in your life.
    - During this thirty-day break, explore and rediscover activities and behaviors that you find satisfying and meaningful.
    - At the end of the break, reintroduce optional technologies into your life, starting from a blank slate. For each technology you reintroduce, determine what value it serves in your life and how specifically you will use it to maximize this value.
