- Focus is crucial for a healthy functioning company
    - In Apple they had a maximum of 3 projects at a time
- Make something you believe in
    + Aim to make company that lasts, that's the hardest work in business
    + It's better to create something to have for yourself, otherwise you won't work the extra hours needed
- Never rely on marketing research
    - People don't know what they want until you show them
    - > "Our task is to read things that are not yet on the page."
- You have to keep pushing to innovate
    - People are afraid or even don't like innovation at first
    - Don't be afraid releasing products that will reduce sales of other your products
    - > "If you don’t cannibalize yourself, someone else will"
- Don't let the company be run by salesmen
    - That's why decline happened to Microsoft, IBM etc.
    - > "The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The company starts valuing the great salesmen, because they’re the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company."
