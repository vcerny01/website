### Review
I can’t say I agree with everything, but it’s indeed a thought-provoking book offering an overview of aboriginal philosophy touching some relevant issues.


I heard about the book in this Jim Rutt Show [episode](https://www.jimruttshow.com/tyson-yunkaporta-1/).

I left out my note about how the Prussian model of education is basically similar to the domestication of animals. (my favourite theory, especially at parties) I guess you read the book for that.
