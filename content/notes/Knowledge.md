- ### Linear and non-linear learning
	- A focus on linear, abstract, declarative knowledge alone not only fails to create complex connectivity but damages the mind.
		- When we feel boredom, we are really just biologically punished for this destructive behavior
			- > Extended periods of this affects a person’s mental health, resulting in bouts of rage, depression and worse. In centralised knowledge institutions today, this illness is called misbehaviour or misconduct.
		- In aboriginal knowledge, the processes are more important than the content
- ### Metaphors
	- Good multi-layerd metaphors are very important in learning
		- > Working with grounded, complex metaphors that have integrity is the difference between decoration and art, tunes and music, commercialised fetishes and authentic cultural practice.
- ### Schools
	- > Schools are sites of political struggle in this civilisation because they are the main vehicles for establishing the grand narratives needed to make progress possible.
		- > The entire history of globalisation hinges on the story of modern public education, how it began and why.
- Cultural knowledge should never be stored just in print or digitally (archives are great, but they are only temporary)
- ### Working with knowledge in the aboriginal tradition
	- *Kinship-mind*
		- > The only sustainable way to store data long-term is within relationships—deep connections between generations of people in custodial relation to a sentient landscape, all grounded in a vibrant oral tradition.
			-  >This doesn’t need to replace print, but it can supplement it magnificently—those two systems might back each other up rather than merely coexist.

				- This is the image for kinship-mind, which is about relationships and connectedness.
			- > In Aboriginal worldviews, nothing exists outside of a relationship to something else.
				- > There are no isolated variables—every element must be considered in relation to the other elements and the context. Areas of knowledge are integrated, not separated.
				- > The relationship between the knower and other knowers, places and senior knowledge-keepers is paramount. It facilitates shared memory and sustainable knowledge systems.
	- *Story-mind*
		- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FVitecek%2FBbtCp6Ot-i.jpg?alt=media&token=d9fa7897-7d96-4831-a53e-b9bcd6f15a68)
			- This is the image for story-mind, which is about the role of narrative in memory and knowledge transmission.
		- >It is the most powerful tool for memorisation, particularly when connected meaningfully to place.
			- > This is how songlines have worked in Australia for millennia to store knowledge in stories mapped in the land and reflected in the night sky. It includes yarning as a method of knowledge production and transmission. Today it is also about challenging grand narratives and histories.
	- *Dreaming-mind*
		- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FVitecek%2FJjuLZFvyGI.jpg?alt=media&token=fb43c275-55b3-4853-91b0-35d8f203f26a)
			- This is the image for dreaming-mind, which is all about using metaphors to work with knowledge.
		- > The circle on the left represents abstract knowledge, and the circle on the right represents tangible knowledge. The lines above and below represent communication between these physical and non-physical worlds, which occurs through metaphors.
		- > These are images, dance, song, language, culture, objects, ritual, gestures and more. Feedback loops between the worlds must be completed with practical action.
	- *Ancestor-mind*
		- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FVitecek%2F0ikTvKsMKE.jpg?alt=media&token=71de4a81-afdd-43c1-993a-0795fc60ce62)
			- This is the image for ancestor-mind, which is all about deep engagement, connecting with a timeless state of mind or ‘alpha wave state’, an optimal neural state for learning.
		- > We can reach this state through most Aboriginal cultural activities. It is characterised by complete concentration, engagement and losing track of linear time.
		- > Ancestor-mind can involve immersive visualisation and extra-cognitive learning such as revealed knowledge in dreams and inherited knowledge in cellular memory.
	- *Pattern-mind*
		- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FVitecek%2FQCr7V_qlj_.jpg?alt=media&token=b1c10463-9183-4e4f-b5b0-9aaa34d41e7b)
			-  This is the image for pattern-mind, which is about seeing entire systems and the trends and patterns within them, using these to make accurate predictions and find solutions to complex problems.
		- > There are three lines with three sections. Each section represents the line from the kinship-mind symbol, which is two elements linked by a relationship. You can see at each point a new pair begins, linked by a new relationship. It is about truly holistic, contextual reasoning.
