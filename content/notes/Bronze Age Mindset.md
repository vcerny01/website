## Review
I spent too much time at Twitter before Christmas.

Well, this alt-right classic is certainly a thought-provoking read. I don't really agree with the book on most topics (it's kinda fascist, so if you're sensitive to that, don't read it). Also, most ideas presented are incompatible with Christianity.

BAP argues it's an exhortation, but that's kinda [cope](https://americanmind.org/salvo/which-way-jester-man/).
