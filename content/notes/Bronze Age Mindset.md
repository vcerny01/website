## Review
I spent too much time at Twitter before Christmas, so I was eventually memed into reading this alt-right classic.

Well, certainly a though-provoking read. I don't really agree with the book on most topics (it's kinda fascist, so if you're sensitive to that, don't read it). Also, most ideas presented are incompatible with Christianity. Still, frankly, alt-right literature still makes more sense than literature of the radical left.
