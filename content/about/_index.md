## About me
<img src="/images/main/me.jpg" style="float:right; border-radius: 100%; max-width: 140px">

I'm a high school student interested in technology, music, history and everything contrarian.

## Why I made this website

This is my place on the internet. Here I share my thoughts, notes, photos, etc. 

In February of 2022, I decided to remake my website from scratch so that I could easily share my notes here. I use the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) SSG. ([repository](https://github.com/vcerny01/website))

I don't particularly enjoy doing frontend stuff, but it's fun doing web development for myself.

## Legal

To make use of my photos, contact me. Otherwise, refer to the GPL v3 license under which I release this website.

Sometimes I use citations extensively in my notes. If you think anything is violating your rights, contact me.
