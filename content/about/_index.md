## About me

I'm a high school student interested in technology, music, history and everything contrarian.

## Why I made this website

This is my small place on the internet. I share my thoughts, notes, photos... here. 

In the February of 2022 I decided to remake my website from scratch to make it more usable for sharing my notes here on the regular basis. I use the awesome [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) SSG. ([Repo](https://github.com/vcerny01/website) of my website is available on GitHub (everything is very much tailored for my needs, so you'd probably have a bad time making a theme out of it))

I don't really enjoy doing frontend stuff, but it's still fun doing webdev for myself.

## Legal

To make use of my photos, contact me. Otherwise refer to the GPL v3 license under which I release my content for this website.
